# Baozi Steam Buns

## Buns

* 1 tablespoon (1 packet) active dry yeast
* 1 cup warm water, plus additional as needed
* 4 cups all-purpose flour (I like White Lily)
* 2 tablespoons granulated sugar, divided
* 1 teaspoon double-acting baking powder
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt

## Filling

* 8 ounces ground tofu
* 1/4 cup finely chopped Chinese cabbage or bok choy
* 1/4 cup finely chopped scallions
* 2 tablespoons soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon sesame oil
* 1 tablespoon sherry or rice wine

1. In a small bowl, sprinkle yeast over warm water. Proof until bubbly and creamy, about 10 minutes
1. Sift flour, sugar, and baking powder into stand mixer bowl with the dough hook attachment. Add salt
1. Turn mixer on low speed, pour in the warm water-yeast mixture until the dough begins to form a ball
1. Add more water if too dry one tablespoon at a time until it forms a ragged clump. Continue to knead on low speed for 5-10 minutes, until the dough is smooth, shiny, and springy to the touch.
1. Place dough in well-oiled bowl, flipping the dough to coat in oil. Cover with plastic wrap. Store in a warm place until it doubles in size, 2-3 hours
1. Combine filling ingredients. Cut 16 3-inches squares of wax or parchment paper. Spray each square with cooking oil
1. Punch the dough down, then divide in half. Roll each half into a log. Using a pastry cutter, slice each log into 8 pieces. Roll each piece into a ball, then shape into a thin, flat disc. Keep center of the disc thicker than the edges. (Once steamed, this keeps the bun from being too doughy on one side and too thin on the other)
1. Spoon dollop of filling into the center of the disc. Pull edges up and pinch together to form a bun. Place bun on a square of parchment paper, cover with a towel. Allow buns to rest for 20-30 minutes
1. In batches, steam buns for 15 minutes with room on all sides. (Cooked buns will be up to 50 percent larger)
1. Remove the pan and basket from the heat. Let sit for 5 minutes before removing the lid. Microwave 30 seconds to reheat
