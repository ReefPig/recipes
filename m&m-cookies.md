# M&M Cookies

serves: 18-24 cookies, depending on size

* 1 cup packed brown sugar
* ½ cup white sugar
* 1 cup clarified butter or shortening or 1/2 cup butter 1/2 cup shortening mix
* 2 eggs
* 2 teaspoons vanilla
* 2½ cups flour (+ 2-3 tablespoons)
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1½ cups M&M's

0. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, mix the brown sugar, white sugar, clarified butter, eggs, and vanilla with electric mixers on low speed until well mixed.
0. Add the 2½ cups flour, baking soda, and salt. Mix until just combined; I found it easiest to finish this by hand. Add the extra tablespoons of flour until the dough feels thick and almost dry to the touch. Stir the M&M's into the dough.
0. Roll into balls and press extra M&M's into the tops. Flatten slightly with your palm or the back of a wooden spoon. Bake for 8-10 minutes (they will be slightly underbaked). Remove from cookie sheet right away and place on cooling rack. Let stand for 5-10 minutes to help the cookies hold their shape.
